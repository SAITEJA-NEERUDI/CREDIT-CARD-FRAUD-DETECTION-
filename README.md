# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION-
Credit Card Fraud Detection using AdaBoost and Majority Voting
This project implements a system for detecting credit card fraud using AdaBoost and Majority Voting.

Problem Statement:

Credit card fraud is a significant issue for financial institutions and individuals. Identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial for mitigating losses and protecting users.

Methodology:

This project utilizes the following approaches:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the credit card transaction dataset, potentially including feature engineering.
Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features for fraud detection.
AdaBoost: Implementing AdaBoost, an ensemble learning algorithm, to combine multiple weak learners into a strong classifier.
Majority Voting: Combining predictions from multiple base classifiers obtained through AdaBoost.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluating the model's effectiveness using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Running the Project:
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
Open the Netbeans IDE 8.1.
Execute the code cells to perform data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
Analyze the results and visualizations to understand the model's performance.


Results:
The implemented system for credit card fraud detection using AdaBoost and Majority Voting demonstrated promising results. Both models achieved high accuracy, with Majority Voting slightly outperforming AdaBoost. Here are some key observations:

Accuracy: Both models achieved impressive accuracy, exceeding 90% in identifying fraudulent transactions. This indicates their effectiveness in distinguishing legitimate and fraudulent cases.
Precision and Recall: While both models demonstrated high precision, Majority Voting exhibited a slight edge in correctly identifying true positives (fraudulent transactions). This means it captured a higher proportion of actual fraud while minimizing false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraudulent).
F1-Score: Combining precision and recall, the F1-Score offered a balanced view of performance. Majority Voting again displayed a marginal advantage, indicating an overall better balance between identifying true positives and avoiding false positives.
These results suggest that the combined approach of AdaBoost and Majority Voting holds potential for effectively detecting credit card fraud. Further optimization and exploration of other ensemble methods, feature engineering, and real-time integration could potentially lead to even better performance.

Further Work:
Explore other ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
Implement advanced feature engineering techniques.
Integrate the model into a real-time fraud detection system.
Evaluate the model's performance with different datasets.
